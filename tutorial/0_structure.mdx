This Demo App is structured as follows:

- `components` contains some React components used in the app

- `fonts` contains licensed fonts used by Figment

- `pages` contains the client-side pages shown by the app

- `pages/api` contains the Next.js API routes used by the app

- `pages/near-delegate`, `pages/near-undelegate` and `pages/near-transfer` contain the client-side pages used in each Staking API flow

- `pages/tutorial/[doc].tsx` contains the code used to display Markdown (MDX) files for this Demo App Tutorial

- `pages/create-near-account.tsx` is the page used to create a new, randomly named NEAR account on testnet

- `public` contains the images and non-text content used in the Demo App

- `styles` contains the CSS used to style the Demo App

- `tutorial` contains the Demo App Tutorial content in Markdown format

- `.env` contains the Figment API key used to access the Staking API

- `.gitignore` lists files which should be ignored by git &mdash; it's imperative that `.env` always be listed in this file to prevent API keys being leaked.

- In addition to the project manifest file `package.json`, the remaining files in the project root directory are used for configuration of TypeScript and Next.js
