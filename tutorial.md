# Integrating with the Staking API

...

## Flows

The Figment Staking API works with the concept of flows, a specific set of actions to be completed. More information is available in the [Staking API Overview](https://docs.figment.io/guides/staking-api/) on the Figment Docs.

In this tutorial, we'll focus on the delegation or "staking" flow for NEAR.

This Staking API flow has multiple steps, which include:

1. Initializing the flow by specifying the network (`near`), the chain code (`testnet`), the operation (`staking`) and the Staking API version number (`v1`)
2. Submitting details for the transaction. The Staking API creates a transaction payload which needs to be signed. This payload includes details like the address from which tokens will be delegated and its public key, the validator address to which the tokens will be delegated, and an amount of tokens to delegate
3. Confirming the transaction details and signing the transaction payload
4. Broadcasting the signed transaction to the network
5. Confirming that the flow state has changed to `delegated`, meaning that the flow is complete and the delegated tokens are actively earning staking rewards

## Testnet account

To demonstrate the Staking API and delegating tokens, we will first need to create a testnet account on NEAR so that we have some tokens to work with.

If you're curious, read more about the [NEAR account model](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/model) and [Access Keys](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/access-keys) to understand how keypairs function on NEAR. You don't need to dive into this topic to understand the Staking API, but it is useful to know how transaction signing works.

The relevant code is in the file `pages/api/createAccount.js`, which uses the [NEAR JavaScript API](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference) to generate a random `ed25519` keypair. We store this keypair in the application state for convenience, backing it up to your browsers localStorage so you can pause during the tutorial and come back later without losing your keypair.

- Note: `ed25519` refers to the type of [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages) that the keypair is using. This is also explicitly referenced by the prefix `ed25519:` before the public and private keys.

This private key can be used to sign transaction payloads generated by the Staking API, simulating either an individual user or a custodian using the Staking API.

**Important**: Strictly speaking, private keys should _not_ be stored in a web browser, and any keypairs used on mainnet should be treated with extreme care. For this reason, we **strongly** recommend that you do not import any other keypairs for use in this demo app.

The keypairs generated by this demo app are intended for use on the testnet, and so long as they are only used within the context of this demo app, there is no real security concern. Remember: This is for learning purposes only. In production, you will absolutely want to handle signing offline and preferably using an encrypted secrets vault such as Hashicorp's [Vault Project](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

TLDR; `pages/api/createAccount.js` will provide you with a randomly generated .testnet address, which is automatically provided with a balance of 200 NEAR tokens upon creation. The account is comprised of an account ID and a keypair: A public key and a private key.

## Integrated, Delegated

Armed with a Figment API key to access the Staking API and a NEAR testnet account with tokens, the first step is to initialize a new staking flow.

Any time a flow is initialized, we are provided with a unique flow ID. It is important to store the flow ID, at least until the flow has been completed. Without the flow ID, we can't continue the flow.

When data is submitted to a flow, the Staking API will construct an unsigned transaction payload, providing it to us in the response body. It is then up to the account holder (in this case, us!) to sign the transaction, which authorizes the delegation of tokens from the delegator's account to the validator address.

Sign the transaction payload with the private key of the generated keypair. Once the payload is signed, it can be submitted to the Staking API which will then broadcast the transaction to the network.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the delegation is active and the staked tokens will be earning staking rewards until they are undelegated.

### Client-side and Server-side

Code in `/pages/index.js` is being run on the client-side, in the web browser.

Code in the `/pages/api` directory is being run on the server-side, _not_ in the web browser.

## Step 1: Create a Flow

Let's begin the process of completing the demo app code so that it functions properly!

To get started, open the files `pages/index.js` and `pages/api/delegateFlow.js` in your code editor.

You will need to complete the code in these files. Do so by uncommenting fetch requests and fixing relevant lines of code as instructed, then saving the files before continuing to the next step of the tutorial.

In `pages/index.js`, we've provided an input for the amount and a "STAKE" button. When the user wants to stake, they can input a number of tokens and click the button to initiate the staking process.

Since you've checked out the `tutorial` branch of this repository, the STAKE button &mdash; which is defined in the file `components/AccountCard.js` &mdash; won't work right away.

When this button is clicked, we'll need to perform an asynchronous fetch call to the Staking API, passing a valid Figment API key and the parameters needed to begin a new delegation flow.

In the file `pages/api/delegateFlow.js`, uncomment the fetch request by removing lines 8 and 24, then save the file.

```js
/**
  const response = await fetch(`https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      flow: {
        network_code: body.network_code,
        chain_code: body.chain_code,
        operation: body.operation,
        version: body.version,
      },
    }),
  });
*/
```

- This fetch request is a POST containing the necessary headers and a JSON body, being sent to the Staking API endpoint for NEAR: `https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows`
- The JSON body must have the correct parameters. Read more about them in the Figment Docs [here](https://docs.figment.io/guides/staking-api/near/delegate/create-new-flow)

In the file `pages/index.js`, refer to the first fetch request inside the `delegate` function:

```js
    response = await fetch("/api/delegateFlow", {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        network_code: "cosmos",
        chain_code: "testnet",
        operation: "staking",
        version: "v1"
      })
    });
```

Somebody accidentally set the `network_code` to `cosmos`! You'll need to change it to `near` so the correct flow is initialized.

- This POST request is going to be processed by `delegateFlow.js`, passing the parameters `network_code`, `chain_code`, `operation` and `version` to initialize a new flow.

- The response to this fetch request will contain the details of the initialized flow which includes the flow `id`, the flow `state`, and the `actions` which can be performed at this stage of the flow. Read more about the specification on the Figment Docs [here](https://docs.figment.io/guides/staking-api/near/delegate/create-new-flow).

### Balances

Query the account's available balance and staked balance using methods from `near-api-js`, so that we can display them on the client-side:

```js
export default async function (req, res) {
    if (!req.query.account) return res.status(406).send('missing account id');
    const client = await connect(nearConfig);
    const account = await client.account(req.query.account);
    const balance = await account.getAccountBalance();
    const staked = await account.getActiveDelegatedStakeBalance();
    return res.status(200).json({ 
        available: undefined,
        staked: undefined 
    });
}
```

Oops! Somebody left the return values as `undefined`. We'd better fix this by returning a parsed floating point integer.

In the file `pages/api/getNearBalance.js`, replace the `undefined` values on lines 11 and 12 with the following code, then save the file:

```js
      available: Number.parseFloat(balance.total || 0),
      staked: Number.parseFloat(staked.total || 0) 
```

## Step 2: Creating a Delegation Transaction

Perform another fetch request to the Staking API to continue the flow with the correct inputs. Keep in mind that when continuing with a flow, we need to use a PUT request, not a POST request.

In the file `pages/api/submitData.js`, uncomment the fetch request by removing lines 8 and 17, then save the file.

```js
/**
    const response = await fetch(`https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/${flow_id}/next`, {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        Authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
*/
```

Still working within the `delegate` function in `pages/index.js`, use the `inputs` from the [Staking API response](https://docs.figment.io/guides/staking-api/near/delegate/create-new-flow#sample-response) to fulfil our client-side fetch request:

```js
    response = await fetch("/api/submitData", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        flow_id,
        name: actions[0].name,
        inputs: {
          delegator_address: appState.accountId,
          delegator_pubkey: appState.publicKey,
          validator_address: validator_address,
          amount: Number.parseFloat(stakeAmount),
          max_gas: null
        }
      })
    })
```

- Keep using the same `flow_id` until the flow is completed
- The `name` field is the name of the action we're taking &mdash; `create_delegate_tx`
- The `inputs` will be: `delegator_address`, `delegator_pubkey`, `validator_address`, `amount` and an optional `max_gas` amount

## Step 3: Signing the Transaction

The Staking API response will include an unsigned transaction payload, after you have submitted the delegation data. The unsigned transaction payload appears in two locations in the response:

- In the `actions`, under the `inputs` array of the action `sign_delegate_tx` as `transaction_payload`
- Also in the `data` object, as the `raw` property of the `delegate_transaction` object.

**Note**: The `signing_payload` is only used when signing with a custodial solution such as the Fireblocks API. Refer to our guide on [Signing Transactions with the Fireblocks API](https://docs.figment.io/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions) for more information.

To get the unsigned transaction payload from the `raw` property of `delegate_transaction`, locate this code on line 69 of `pages/index.js`, uncomment it then save the file:

```js
// const transaction_payload = json.data.delegate_transaction.raw;
```

The payload is then passed to the `sign` method of the npm package `@figmentio/slate`, which abstracts some of the difficulty for networks supported by the Staking API. You could also use a network-specific client library for signatures, such as `near-api-js` - which is precisely what the `@figmentio/slate` npm package is doing. Keep it DRY!

The `sign` method takes four parameters: The `network`, the API `version`, the unsigned transaction payload, and an array of private keys used to sign the transaction:

```js
  const signed_payload = await slate.sign("near", "v1", transaction_payload, [secretKey]);
```

When necessary, an options object can be passed as a fifth parameter. NEAR does not require any extra options for signing, so we're not passing it as a parameter here. Networks such as Cosmos and Polkadot require options to be passed when signing.

## Step 4: Broadcasting the Transaction

The signed transaction payload must now be sent to the Staking API to be broadcast to the network.

To send the signed payload, perform another fetch request. The parameters are the `name` of the action we're performing; `sign_delegate_tx` and the `inputs`; an object with the property `transaction_payload` and a value that is the signed payload.

Uncomment the fetch request in `pages/api/broadcastTx.js` by removing lines 8 and 22, then save the file:

```js
/**
    const response = await fetch(`https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/${flow_id}/next`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: {
        "Authorization": process.env.API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        "name": "sign_delegate_tx",
        "inputs": {
          "transaction_payload": signed_payload
        }
      })
    });
*/
```

When the signed payload has been broadcast to the network, the flow state will change to `delegate_tx_broadcast`.
While the flow is in this state, the transaction is awaiting confirmation on the blockchain.

## Step 5: Flow State

Since the transaction will not take long to confirm, we can check the flow state manually. We simply want to know when the flow state becomes `delegated`, then update our available balance and staked balance on the client-side. We can perform a GET request to the Staking API endpoint to get the curent status of the flow, using its flow ID.

In the file `pages/api/getFlowState.js`, uncomment the fetch request by removing lines 7 and 14, then save the file:

```js
/**
    const response = await fetch(`https://near-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows/${flow_id}`, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            Authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
        }
    });
*/
```

## Tutorial Complete

Congratulations, you've successfully completed the code to integrate the Figment Staking API into a full stack application!

You should now be able to run the demo app successfully. Check the instructions in `README.md`.

TLDR; Make sure your Figment API key is in `.env`, the tutorial is complete, then start the Next.js development server with the terminal command `npm run dev`. Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Try creating an account, then staking some of your testnet NEAR tokens in real time with a single click.

If you have not already, please take some time to review the code in `pages/api` and `pages/index.js` to understand the interactions between client-side and server-side. Since you've cloned this repository to your local machine, feel free to experiment further.

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and we can't wait to see how you integrate Figment APIs into your use case!
