Welcome to the Figment Staking API Demo App!

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how easy it can be to integrate with Figment's Universal Staking API. 
Going forward, we'll simply refer to this as the **Staking API**.

## Glossary

Let's begin by covering a few important terms that you may not be familiar with:

- **Networks** and **Blockchains** &mdash; These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, meaning that blockchains are peer to peer networks. Sometimes "network" is used to mean a mainnet or a testnet.

- **Mainnet** and **Testnet** &mdash; Many blockchains operate testnets, which helps developers to rigorously test their products before moving into production on the main network or "mainnet".

- **NEAR** &mdash; The NEAR Protocol is a Proof of Stake blockchain. It uses the NEAR token as its native token, which enables users to pay transaction fees and to transfer value.

- **Token Faucet** &mdash; When using a testnet, it is usually necessary to access a token faucet to acquire testnet tokens. NEAR was chosen for this demonstration as all NEAR testnet accounts are automatically provided with 200 NEAR tokens, removing the need to use a token faucet.

- **Delegator** &mdash; This is you. Or, perhaps more importantly, an individual. An entity who is delegating (also known as "staking") tokens to a validator.

- **Validator** &mdash; A participant in the consensus of the Proof of Stake (also known as "PoS") network.

- **Transaction** &mdash; An action on the network involving multiple parties. Examples include transfer of tokens, staking tokens, smart contract interactions and more.

- **Signature** &mdash; A cryptographic proof that the owner of a private key (a user on the network) signed a message or transaction. This is similar to signing a physical cheque or contract.

- **Address** &mdash; This identifies a user on the network. On some networks, this is also the public key of a cryptographic keypair (a private key and a public key form a keypair). In the case of NEAR, a human readable address can also be used.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

- <Link href="https://git-scm.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">git</Link> &mdash; If you're cloning the code repository from GitHub, you might also use <Link href="https://gitpod.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitPod</Link>.
- <Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Node.js</Link> &mdash; v14 is the minimum version required to run Next.js
- A code editor, we recommend <Link href="https://code.visualstudio.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</Link>
- Working knowledge of <Link href="https://www.javascript.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript</Link> / <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TypeScript</Link> &mdash; TS has a minimal impact on the code scaffolded by Next.js and does not interfere with, nor is it required by the Figment Staking API.

## Milestones

In the following steps we will describe how to recreate the Delegation flow from this demo app.
Generally, this will cover how to integrate the Figment Universal Staking API into a full stack application.
With a little bit of study, you can extrapolate the needed learnings for both frontend and backend from the demo app and this tutorial.

The first milestone is having a working connection with the Staking API.

The second milestone is being able to complete an entire Staking API delegation flow.

The final milestone is being able to control the process of working with the Staking API, and store state for existing Staking API flows that you have created.

## Tech Stack

Under the hood, this application is comprised of:

- <Link href="https://nextjs.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next.js</Link> &mdash; The project was scaffolded by `npx create-next-app@latest --ts` (see the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript))

- <Link href="https://typescriptlang.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TypeScript</Link> &mdash; Type safety and JavaScript. Name a more iconic duo!

- NEAR Protocol's <Link href="https://github.com/near/near-api-js" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript API</Link> &mdash; NEAR is a blockchain with a web focus. Check out [Figment Learn](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/near) for more info about NEAR, including links to further resources.

- Figment's <Link href="https://npmjs.org/figmentio/slate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">npm package</Link> &mdash; This code library simplifies the payload decoding and transaction signing process for multiple networks. 

- <Link href="https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cross-fetch</Link> &mdash; A universal fetch API that works everywhere.

- <Link href="https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/main#readme" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@emotion/react</Link> &mdash; CSS-in-JS for visual styling. Styling is outside the scope of this tutorial, however it is an important consideration for a fullstack application, and there are many different approaches to this topic. 

## Implementation

The focus of this tutorial will be on integrating with the Staking API. This requires that you send and receive data using HTTP requests. 
The cross-fetch library is what we will use to accomplish this.

When it is necessary to sign a transaction payload using a keypair, we will use the code library `@figmentio/slate` to perform the signing action.

We've provided a page which can generate fresh NEAR testnet accounts with a random alphanumeric identifier. 
These accounts are meant for use in development, and to rapidly demonstrate the usage of the Staking API.

## Private Keys Disclaimer

The code in `pages/create-near-account.tsx` creates a randomly generated account name, and the private key for this account is kept in the local storage of your web browser.

This is _only_ meant to provide a seamless experience for the demo.

In practice, private keys should never be exposed, shared, and especially not stored in browser local storage.

### **The keypairs used in this demo app are for use on the NEAR testnet only!** 

If you have any further questions about keypairs on NEAR, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the <Link href="https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEAR account model</Link> before proceeding.
